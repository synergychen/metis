# Week 4: Using Rails

You can break views into partials, and know when you'd want to.

You can write simple validations (with a little help from the
docs).

You can implement `belongs_to` and `has_many` relationships
without too much difficulty.

You could theoretically do a many-to-many relationship with
`has_many :through`.

A lot of database stuff we covered in Week #2 makes way more sense
now. You understand how foreign keys are used, and how they relate to
relationships between models. You understand that ActiveRecord methods
map to SQL queries, though you probably don't understand how that's
done.

You can write ActiveRecord scopes, and know why and when it's
appropriate to use them.

You understand what a database index is, and when to use one.

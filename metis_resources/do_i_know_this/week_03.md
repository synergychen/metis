# Week 3: Intro to Rails

You can explain the structure of MVC. You know what models,
controllers, and views are for.

You conceptually understand how routes map to controller actions.

REST kinda makes sense. You pretty much get the central "HTTP verbs ->
controller actions -> database operations" conceptual framework. You
can relate this model to the notion of "resources" in routing.

You know the routes generated for `resources :wombats`, including the HTTP verbs,
path helper methods, paths, controllers, and actions.

You know that models and controllers don't have to have a one-to-one
mapping.

You can use path and link helpers.

You can write some simple forms using `form_for`.

You know what `CRUD` stands for.

You can write a migration and run it to change your database. You can
index columns, and understand why you'd want to. You can kinda explain
how indexing works, with some hand-waving.

You can use `before_action`s for authentication. You can imagine using
them for other stuff, too.

You know how authentication works, and you *might* be able to roll
your own authentication system. Luckily, you know better, and can use
a gem like `clearance` or `devise` instead.

You can write and deploy a simple blog, todo list manager, or url shortener.

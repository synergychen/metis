# Do I Know This?

Students often wonder how they're measuring up. They think, "Am I
learning what I'm supposed to be learning? How can I tell? *WHAT IF
I'M SECRETLY A HUGE IMPOSTER AND I'M FOOLING EVERYONE AND THEY JUST
HAVEN'T CAUGHT ON YET?*"

Let these documents set your mind at ease.

Each week lists a few statements or snippets of code. After you've
completed a week, check yourself against the associated
document. Ideally, the statements are all true and the code samples
all make sense to you. If they do, sweet! You're definitely on
track. If a couple of statements aren't true, those are some things
you might want to work on. If a *lot* of the statements don't describe
you, come talk to an instructor and we'll help set you straight.

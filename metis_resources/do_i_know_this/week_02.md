# Week 2: Web Servers and Databases

You know what a relational database is for. You can explain why/when a
relational database is preferable to, say, a bunch of text files.

You know what primary and foreign keys are, and how they're related.

You can populate a database from a dump.

You can execute relatively complicated queries on a single table. You
might need to check the syntax, but you know when to use `ORDER`,
`GROUP BY`, `LIKE`, `COUNT`, and so on.

You know what a `JOIN` is for, and could write a simple one.

You understand the different types of columns in a database, and you
know when you'd want to use each different kind.

Given a description of a simple app, you can come up with a reasonable
ERD to describe it.

You can modify a database. You know the difference between `insert`
and `update`.

You can explain what a web server is *for*, even if you don't know how
one works.

You can explain how an HTTP request passes through a Sinatra app. Your
description would include an HTTP request, a server, routing, the
database, rendering, and returning a response.

The main HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) make sense. You
understand how they map to database operations (`SELECT`, `INSERT`,
`UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

You know the meaning of a few common status codes, like 200, 404, and
500.

You can describe an ActiveRecord model, and you understand (in basic
terms) how it relates to the database.

You know what an ORM does.

You know that params is data that comes from user input. Specifically,
the URL and form input.

You can build a simple database-backed Sinatra app with
ActiveRecord. It can handle some CRUD operations and manages gems with
Bundler. You can complete the flashcard example in the curriculum.
